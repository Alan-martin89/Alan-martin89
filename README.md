###About Me
I started my development journey at the start of the first covid pandemic (U.K) when my car painting company closed.
Since then I have been studying HTML and CSS and JavaScript.
I am now at a comfortable level to build and deploy static websites for small businesses in my local area and also now futher a field.
If you would like me to work with you please feel free to get in touch.
